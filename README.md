# 👋 Hi, I’m Atik.
### UI/UX Designer and Researcher


![cover](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6778ddb3-23a5-4fd7-846d-79c4689e787a)


I help businesses and product teams design clear, intuitive, and scalable digital experiences across websites, web apps, and mobile applications.

My philosophy is simple:
User-first design reduces rework, saves development time, and lowers business risk.
If we understand users early, everything downstream moves faster.

What I do

- UX/UI Design – Thoughtful, usable interfaces for web, mobile, and SaaS products
- UX Research & Product Audits – Identifying usability gaps, user needs, and growth opportunities
- Wireframing & Prototyping – Turning ideas into testable, interactive flows
- Information Architecture (IA) – Structuring content and features for clarity and ease of use

How I work

- Research-led, not guess-led
- Collaborate with developers and stakeholders
- Focused on clarity, usability, and real-world constraints

As a freelance partner, I value clear communication, realistic timelines, and high-quality delivery—no fluff—just practical design that works.
